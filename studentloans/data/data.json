Moreover, those experiments do not measure long-term, general equilibrium effects.

Moreover, those experiments do not measure long-term, general equilibrium effects.

They find that an exogenous shock in income induced by a change in EITC policy increase educational attainment and employment in adulthood, and this is done through increasing pre-tax income.
