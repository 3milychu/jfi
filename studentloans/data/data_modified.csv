the Discourse on Antipoverty Policy: Reconsidering a Negative Income Tax. Journal of Poverty. 2015. ","Wiederspan et al argue that a negative income tax can help fill the gaps in current federal means-tested assistance programs which tend not to be sufficiently large and far-reaching. While past NIT experiments have led to a reduction in labor supply, the effects were not as large as often speculated, and time saved from work was spent on childcare and looking for work. Moreover, those experiments do not measure long-term, general equilibrium effects. They then show that an NIT can be funded using expenditure from existing programs which it potentially replaces, and if the marginal tax rate was chosen carefully. Finally, they assert that a NIT can be made more politically appeasing by appealing to the fact that it coheres with people’s values rather than focusing on the technical policy details, as well as by highlighting the economic and social costs of poverty to society.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10875549.2014.991889,,,,,,Presenting the case for implementing a negative income tax - some arguments are applicable to a UBI,1,0,0,0,0,,,,40000,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3milychu/jfi/master/studentloans/assets/1.jpg

July 2018.,"Bastian and Michelmore examine the long-run impact of an EITC on children who were exposed to EITC variations by using EITC exposure as an instrument for family income. They used data from the 1968 to 2013 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics which captures four decades of variation in EITC. They find that an exogenous shock in income induced by a change in EITC policy increase educational attainment and employment in adulthood, and this is done through increasing pre-tax income. Their reduced-form estimate suggest that an increase of $1000 in EITC exposure increases high school graduation and college graduation by 1.3% and 4.2% respectively for children exposed to the increase when they were between the ages of 13 to 18. It also raises the probability of them being employed by 1.0%.

","Wiederspan et al argue that a negative income tax can help fill the gaps in current federal means-tested assistance programs which tend not to be sufficiently large and far-reaching. While past NIT experiments have led to a reduction in labor supply, the effects were not as large as often speculated, and time saved from work was spent on childcare and looking for work. Moreover, those experiments do not measure long-term, general equilibrium effects. They then show that an NIT can be funded using expenditure from existing programs which it potentially replaces, and if the marginal tax rate was chosen carefully. Finally, they assert that a NIT can be made more politically appeasing by appealing to the fact that it coheres with people’s values rather than focusing on the technical policy details, as well as by highlighting the economic and social costs of poverty to society.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10875549.2014.991889,,,,,,Presenting the case for implementing a negative income tax - some arguments are applicable to a UBI,1,0,0,0,0,,,,40000,
Jacob Bastian and Katherine Michelmore. The Long-Term Impact of the Earned Income Tax Credit on Children’s Education and Employment Outcomes. Journal of Labor Economics. July 2018.,"Bastian and Michelmore examine the long-run impact of an EITC on children who were exposed to EITC variations by using EITC exposure as an instrument for family income. They used data from the 1968 to 2013 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics which captures four decades of variation in EITC. They find that an exogenous shock in income induced by a change in EITC policy increase educational attainment and employment in adulthood, and this is done through increasing pre-tax income. Their reduced-form estimate suggest that an increase of $1000 in EITC exposure increases high school graduation and college graduation by 1.3% and 4.2% respectively for children exposed to the increase when they were between the ages of 13 to 18. It also raises the probability of them being employed by 1.0%. However, EITC exposure had no significant effects on children below the age of 13 conditional upon later exposure.",https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/697477,U.S.A.,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,,,Y,40000,
